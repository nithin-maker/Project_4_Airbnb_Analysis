# Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains code for analyzing and visualizing Airbnb data using Python, Streamlit, MongoDB, and Tableau/Power BI.

## Overview

Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting hosts with guests seeking accommodations. This project aims to provide insights into Airbnb listings, pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and geospatial distribution through data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Features

- Interactive web application built with Streamlit
- Data exploration tabs for analyzing different aspects of Airbnb data
- Visualizations using libraries such as Plotly Express, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
- Information about Airbnb's background, history, and project overview


## Approach

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**: Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas to retrieve the Airbnb dataset. Perform queries and data retrieval operations to extract necessary information for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and transforming data types. Prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**: Develop a Streamlit web application to create interactive maps visualizing the distribution of Airbnb listings across different locations. Explore prices, ratings, and other factors interactively.

4. **Price Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize price variations across locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations.

5. **Availability Analysis by Season**: Analyze listing availability based on seasonal variations. Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year.

6. **Location-Based Insights**: Investigate price variations across locations using MongoDB queries and data aggregation techniques. Visualize insights on interactive maps or dashboards.

7. **Interactive Visualizations**: Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations enabling users to filter and drill down into the data. Interact with visualizations to explore specific regions, property types, or time periods.

8. **Dashboard Creation**: Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create comprehensive dashboards presenting key insights from the analysis. Combine different visualizations to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset.
